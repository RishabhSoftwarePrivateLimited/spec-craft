name: speccraft.decompose
description: Decompose approved, in-scope LLD(s) into delivery tasks. Use when user runs $speccraft.decompose or asks to break an approved LLD into tasks. Supports an "auto" mode that runs unattended, with no human approval gate.
---
Read `spec/commands/speccraft.decompose.md` in full, then decompose the approved, in-scope LLD(s) into delivery tasks.

Input: read the arguments the user supplied after invoking this skill as an optional leading `auto` token, then the LLD file path(s) — `<lld-fe-file> <lld-be-file>` when Layer Scope = both, or `<lld-file>` for a single-layer project. `auto` present -> auto mode; absent -> interactive mode (default).

Rules before starting (interactive mode):
- confirm every in-scope LLD file exists and its status is `approved`
- confirm the argument count matches this project's Layer Scope (`spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` §Layer Scope)
- active phase must be planning
- read all documents listed in the "Documents This Command Must Use" section of spec/commands/speccraft.decompose.md
- produce task files, each with a mandatory Layer: frontend|backend field, in spec/tasks/<module>/ (mirrored per business module, flat, no tasks/ subfolder)
- update traceability in the current story's shard: spec/traceability/<mirrored-business-path>/TRACEABILITY.md
- after producing tasks: output task list + execution order + sizing rationale + minimal handoff block, then STOP
- do not begin execution or scaffold
- do not self-approve the decomposition
- wait for human approval before execution begins

Rules before starting (auto mode — `auto` token present):
- same confirmations, same required input, and same task production as interactive mode above
- do not pause for the decomposition review gate — apply `spec/commands/speccraft.decompose.md` § Auto Mode instead: the agent self-reviews the task set against the same checklist a human reviewer would use, `revise` findings get up to 2 automatic retries (unresolved concerns logged as Accepted Issues, never dropped), and a `blocked` conflict is resolved and logged (`Approver: auto-mode-ai`) instead of escalated
- still do not begin execution or scaffold — this command does not auto-chain into the next stage even in auto mode
- report the same minimal handoff block with `Mode: auto`, then stop

The canonical contract documents the dual-input signature (`/speccraft.decompose <lld-fe-file> <lld-be-file>`) for Layer Scope = both, a single-file signature for single-layer projects, the mandatory Layer field on every emitted task, the full `auto` signatures, and § Auto Mode mechanics.

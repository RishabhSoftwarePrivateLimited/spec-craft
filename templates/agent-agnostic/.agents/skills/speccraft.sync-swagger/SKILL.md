name: speccraft.sync-swagger
description: Sync a module's API contract from its configured Swagger URL. Human-triggered only, never part of speccraft.orchestrate. Use when user runs $speccraft.sync-swagger or asks to refresh a module's OpenAPI contract.
---
Read `spec/commands/speccraft.sync-swagger.md` and `spec/architecture/API-CONTRACT-SOURCE.md` in full, then sync the named module's contract from its configured Swagger URL.

Input: read the module name the user supplied after invoking this skill.

Rules before starting:
- confirm `spec/architecture/API-CONTRACT-SOURCE.md` has a configured Swagger URL entry for the module before fetching — if missing, stop and report
- fetch the live spec; convert JSON to YAML if needed (this repo's contract format is YAML-only)
- merge into `contracts/<module>/<module>.yaml` — never blind-overwrite; add/update operations present in the fetch, leave existing entries not present in the fetch untouched
- report a summary of operations added / updated / left untouched
- STOP after reporting — no chaining into any other command
- never treat this command's output as binding over an approved `LLD-BACKEND-<id>.md` touchpoint table — /speccraft.implement always reconciles against the LLD on conflict, not against whatever this command last wrote

The canonical contract documents this as strictly advisory and never part of /speccraft.orchestrate's orchestration — the `/speccraft.sync-swagger <module>` signature is exact.

description: Create the LLD(s) for a business spec file.
mode: agent
---
Read `spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md` in full, then create the LLD(s) for the business spec file provided.

Input: ${input:arguments:optional leading "auto" token, then business spec file path, e.g. spec/business/checkout/STORY-042.md or auto spec/business/checkout/STORY-042.md}

Parse the input: an optional leading `auto` token selects auto mode (see below); consume it first if present, then parse the rest exactly as before. `auto` present -> auto mode; absent -> interactive mode (default).

Rules before starting (interactive mode):
- confirm the business spec file exists and is readable
- active phase must be planning
- read `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` §Layer Scope first (ask interactively if absent and the file is empty/placeholder — never infer)
- read all documents listed in the "Documents This Command Must Use" section of spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md
- produce the LLD(s) for this project's Layer Scope — LLD-FRONTEND-<id>.md and/or LLD-BACKEND-<id>.md — in spec/lld/; when Layer Scope = both, each cites a Companion LLD Reference naming its pair
- update traceability in the current story's shard: spec/traceability/<mirrored-business-path>/TRACEABILITY.md
- after producing every in-scope LLD: output all path(s) + summary + minimal handoff block, then STOP
- do not invoke /speccraft.decompose
- do not self-approve any LLD
- wait for human approval (covering every in-scope LLD as one gate) before any downstream stage runs

Rules before starting (auto mode — `auto` token present):
- same confirmations, same required input, and same LLD production as interactive mode above
- do not pause for the combined review gate — apply `spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md` § Auto Mode instead: the agent self-reviews every in-scope LLD against the same checklist a human reviewer would use, `revise` findings get up to 2 automatic redraft retries (unresolved concerns logged as Accepted Issues, never dropped), and a `blocked` conflict is resolved and logged (`Decided By: auto-mode-ai`) instead of escalated
- still do not invoke /speccraft.decompose — this command does not auto-chain into the next stage even in auto mode
- report the same minimal handoff block with `Mode: auto`, then stop

The canonical contract documents dual-LLD output as the default shape when Layer Scope = both, and single-artifact output for frontend-only or backend-only projects, plus the full `/speccraft.tech-design auto <business-spec-file>` signature and § Auto Mode mechanics.

# speccraft.plan-foundation.md

## Purpose

This document defines the command contract for bootstrapping a **greenfield** project's architecture foundation from a business spec and a stated tech stack — a codebase with no application code yet, as opposed to `/speccraft.onboard`'s brownfield path, which discovers a stack by scanning existing code.

Command shape:

```text
/speccraft.plan-foundation <business-spec-file> "<tech stack description>"
```

`<business-spec-file>` is a path to an existing file under `spec/business/<module>/<STORY-ID>.md`. `<tech stack description>` is a single free-text argument (quote it — it will almost always contain spaces), e.g. `"React + Vite frontend, Node/Express backend, Postgres via Prisma, REST API"`. There is no separate stack-spec file: the description is read once and never re-read from disk.

Argument parsing: the first whitespace-delimited token is the business spec file path (repo convention never puts spaces in `spec/business/` paths); everything after it is the tech stack description, whether or not it is quoted.

---

## Why This Exists

Without this command, greenfield setup has no guided path: root `README.md` §Before You Start and `docs/greenfield-setup.md` describe answering Layer Scope, locking the stack, filling `speccraft.scaffold.md`'s placeholders, and authoring `rules/`/`skills/` content as pure manual, hand-authored steps — no command performs any of them. `/speccraft.tech-design`'s only fallback when these are missing is a bare interactive chat question with no stack-proposal logic. `/speccraft.onboard` fills the equivalent gap for brownfield projects, but explicitly refuses to run without real code to scan — it has nothing to offer a project that is genuinely starting from zero.

This command fills that gap: it drafts, from the named business spec plus a stated tech stack, everything a human would otherwise type by hand into `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`, `speccraft.scaffold.md`, supporting architecture spec files, and `rules/`/`skills/`, and presents it all for one combined human review.

---

## Command Intent

`/speccraft.plan-foundation <business-spec-file> "<tech stack description>"` means:

- read the named business spec and draft a Layer Scope recommendation (`frontend` / `backend` / `both`) — a recommendation for the review gate, never silently applied
- parse the stated tech stack description against the same enumerated Tier 1 decision set `/speccraft.onboard` uses, sourced from what was actually said plus named-stack ecosystem conventions where the description is silent
- draft Tier 2 `rules`/`skills` seed content from the named stack's known idioms — there is no code to scan, so this is convention knowledge, not discovery
- draft Tier 3 fill-in of this project's own `spec/commands/speccraft.scaffold.md` placeholders so scaffold is immediately runnable once approved
- draft Tier 4 supporting architecture spec files (routing/module-boundary/rendering strategy for frontend; data/integration strategy for backend) where the stated stack and Tier 1 decisions actually imply structure worth documenting
- present the Layer Scope recommendation and all four tiers together in one combined human review gate
- on approval, write everything at once
- never scaffold, never touch `spec/business/`, never run against a project that already has real code or already-locked stack decisions

---

## Pre-Execution Checks

0. confirm no real application code already exists for the layer(s) this BRD likely touches — check `src-code-frontend/` and `src-code-backend/` first; if either contains real source (not just boilerplate placeholders), this is not a greenfield project — stop and recommend `/speccraft.onboard [path]` instead, regardless of what `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` currently contains. This check runs before check 1 because existing code is the more specific signal — a project can have locked-but-unscaffolded decisions and still be genuinely greenfield, but it cannot have real running code and still be greenfield.
1. confirm `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` does not already have real `AD-FRONTEND-*`/`AD-BACKEND-*` content — if it does (and check 0 found no code, i.e. decisions were locked but never scaffolded), this command refuses: it is a first-time foundation tool, not a re-lock tool. Point the human at a manual edit of `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` for the specific field that needs to change — `/speccraft.change` is a story-level Change Request mechanism for already-approved LLDs, not an architecture re-lock tool; do not point to it for this case.
2. confirm `<business-spec-file>` exists and is readable under `spec/business/<module>/<STORY-ID>.md`
3. confirm `<tech stack description>` is present and non-empty — if omitted, stop and ask for it in chat rather than drafting from the BRD alone; a stack description is this command's second required input, not optional context

---

## Discovery — Five Tiers By Destination

### Tier 0 — Layer Scope recommendation

Read the business spec's Summary, Scope, Requirements, and Acceptance Criteria sections. Look for frontend signals (form, screen, page, UI, list view, "user sees/enters/clicks") versus backend signals (API, endpoint, persistence, server-assigned, database, "server is the source of truth"). Draft a Layer Scope recommendation (`frontend` / `backend` / `both`) with one line of rationale citing which BRD language drove it (e.g. "BRD describes both a submission form and a server-assigned identifier — recommend `both`"). This is a recommendation, not a silent inference — see Human Review Gate. If the BRD gives no usable signal either way for one layer (e.g. a pure data-migration story with no UI language and no explicit backend language), mark that layer `unclear — human must confirm` in the draft rather than defaulting it in either direction.

### Tier 1 — LLD-required stack decisions → `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` only

Same enumerated decision set as `/speccraft.onboard` Tier 1 — nothing wider:

- **Frontend (`AD-FRONTEND-*`):** framework, UI library, state management, forms, auth/session model, styling, typing, test framework
- **Backend (`AD-BACKEND-*`):** framework, ORM/data-access layer, auth/session model, API style (REST/GraphQL/RPC), messaging/queue choice (if any), typing, test framework
- **Cross-cutting (`AD-X-*`):** API contract shape, CORS policy, token format

Only draft rows for the layer(s) recommended in Tier 0 (subject to the human's final confirmation at the gate — if the human changes Layer Scope at review time, re-draft the affected tier(s) before re-presenting).

Each row carries a `Source` column instead of onboard's `Evidence` column, since there is no code to cite:
- `Source: BRD` — the row's value follows directly from something the business spec states or implies (e.g. "no auth" because the BRD's Non-Goals explicitly excludes authentication)
- `Source: stated-stack` — the value was named explicitly in the `<tech stack description>` argument
- `Source: stack-convention` — the description didn't name this field explicitly; drafted per the Unstated-Field Rule below. Rows sourced this way are the ones most likely to need a `revise`, and must be visually grouped or flagged as such in the presented draft — they are proposed defaults, not restated facts.

**Unstated-Field Rule — deterministic, not a judgment call made fresh each run:** a required Tier 1 field the stack description never names is *always* drafted, never silently skipped. Which value to draft is decided by this fixed order, so the same input produces the same draft every run:

1. **The description states this same field explicitly for the sibling layer, in a full-stack (`both`) description** (e.g. it says "TypeScript" for the backend but never says "TypeScript" or "JavaScript" for the frontend, even though both were described in one pass) — draft the sibling layer's value for consistency, tag `stack-convention`, and note in the row's Notes column that it was inferred from the other layer's stated typing rather than stated for this layer directly. This is a stronger signal than ecosystem convention below and is checked first.
2. **A single ecosystem-idiomatic pairing exists for the named stack** (e.g. a stated Vite frontend implies Vitest as the paired test runner) — draft that pairing, tag `stack-convention`.
3. **No single pairing exists, but a minimal/no-dependency option exists among the peers** (e.g. no UI library named → draft "none"; no state library named → draft "framework built-ins only"; no test runner named for a stated Node backend → draft the language/runtime's own built-in test runner over a third-party library) — draft the minimal option, tag `stack-convention`. Bias toward the smallest footprint specifically *because* it is always a safe, revisable starting point regardless of which peer the human actually wanted.
4. **None of the above applies — the remaining peer options are real architectural alternatives with no minimal/default option among them** (e.g. "Node backend" names no framework at all, and Express/Fastify/Koa are peers with no ecosystem-tiebreaker and no "do nothing" option) — draft the single most widely-adopted peer (highest ecosystem share) rather than blocking, tag `stack-convention`, and note in the row's Notes column which peer(s) were passed over. Still never `blocked` for this case: guessing wrong here costs one `revise` reply, which is strictly cheaper than a mid-draft stop for a field that was never going to block the human from reviewing everything else in the same pass.

**`blocked: [reason]` is reserved for genuine self-contradiction only** — the stated stack description (or the description plus the BRD) asserts two mutually exclusive things about the *same* field (e.g. "React frontend" earlier in the description and "Vue components" later in it), so there is no single value to draft at all, not even a defensible guess. This mirrors onboard's Ambiguous Evidence section, which triggers on the same kind of genuine conflict (two competing frameworks both found in code), not on a field the scan simply never mentions.

### Tier 2 — stack-convention seed content → staged for `rules/` and `skills/`, never `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`

Finer-grained conventions analogous to onboard's Tier 2 (naming conventions, folder substructure beyond the top level, typical data-fetching/data-access patterns, component/service/repository creation patterns, typical test-writing conventions for the named stack) — but derived from the named stack's documented idioms, not scanned from code, since no code exists yet. Cite the convention's basis in the drafted content itself (e.g. "Vite + React convention: colocate a component's test file as `Component.test.tsx` beside `Component.tsx`") so the human reviewing it can tell this is a proposed starting convention, not an observed fact.

**Destination — staged, not final, because the code root doesn't exist yet:** write to `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/rules/`, `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/rules/shared/`, `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/skills/`, `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/skills/shared/` (one `<layer>` tree per confirmed layer) — mirroring exactly the four folders `/speccraft.scaffold` creates under the code root, staged one level up until that root exists. `/speccraft.scaffold`'s step 7 picks this staged content up and moves it into the real root the first time that layer is scaffolded, then removes the staging folder (see `spec/commands/speccraft.scaffold.md`). If a layer's scaffold never runs, its staged seed simply sits unused under `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/` — harmless, not a broken reference.

### Tier 3 — scaffold contract fill-in → `spec/commands/speccraft.scaffold.md` placeholders, this project's own copy

Mechanically derived from the approved Tier 1 rows (not independently drafted — if Tier 1 changes at review, redraft Tier 3 to match before re-presenting):
- `Required Stack` (per resolved layer): concrete install commands for the locked framework/libraries
- `Required Folder Structure` (per resolved layer): a real path/purpose table replacing the `_(fill in once stack is locked)_` placeholder row, following the named stack's idiomatic layout
- `.env.example` entries (per resolved layer): concrete env var names implied by the locked decisions (e.g. `DATABASE_URL` if an ORM/persistence decision is not "none", `SESSION_SECRET` only if an auth/session decision is not "none")
- `Config File Requirements` (per resolved layer): the concrete config file list (e.g. `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`) replacing the placeholder row, each still pointing to `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`/`rules/` as authority exactly as the existing placeholder text does — this command fills in *which files*, it does not duplicate their content

### Tier 4 — supporting architecture spec files → `spec/architecture/`, indexed in `spec/ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCES.md`

For each confirmed layer, draft the structural docs root `README.md` §Before You Start step 4 describes: frontend routing conventions, module boundaries, and rendering strategy; backend data-access layering and integration strategy. Follow the shape of `examples/greenfield-demo/spec/architecture/FRONTEND-STRUCTURE.md` and `BACKEND-STRUCTURE.md` (or, for a project with real code already present via a prior onboard, `examples/brownfield-demo`'s equivalents) as the reference: a `## Agent Delta` section immediately after the title, then the structural content, then a `## Related` section pointing back to `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCES.md`, and `speccraft.scaffold.md`.

Write only what the stated stack and approved Tier 1 decisions actually imply — a stated router (e.g. Next.js, React Router) earns a routing-conventions section; a stated stack naming no router and no second screen in the BRD gets a thinner document or none at all, never an invented convention. A layer whose stack gives no structural decisions beyond Tier 1 legitimately produces an empty Tier 4 — that is an expected outcome, not a gap to flag at review.

Each drafted file gets its own `## Agent Delta` section (this is the step-4-file portion of root `README.md` step 11, alongside `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`'s own delta) and a new row in `spec/ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCES.md`'s architecture documents table so agents pick it up in their read order.

---

## Human Review Gate

Present the Tier 0 Layer Scope recommendation, Tier 1 rows, Tier 2 seed drafts, Tier 3 scaffold fill-in, and any Tier 4 files together as one combined review — same single-pass principle as onboard, extended to include the Layer Scope recommendation itself instead of gating it separately beforehand.

Respond with: `approved` / `revise: [reason]` / `blocked: [reason]` — same vocabulary as every other gate in this workflow (`spec/workflows/shared/SHARED-POLICIES.md`).

If the human's response changes the Layer Scope recommendation (confirms a different value than drafted), redraft Tier 1 through Tier 4 for the corrected layer set before re-presenting — do not write a stale draft for a layer the human just excluded, or skip a layer the human just added.

Only on `approved` does the agent write, in this order:
1. `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`: `## Agent Delta`, `## Layer Scope`, the confirmed `AD-FRONTEND-*`/`AD-BACKEND-*`/`AD-X-*` rows
2. `spec/architecture/rules-seed/<layer>/` staged Tier 2 content, per confirmed layer
3. `spec/commands/speccraft.scaffold.md`'s placeholder sections, per confirmed layer
4. any Tier 4 supporting architecture spec files, plus their `spec/ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCES.md` rows

Nothing is locked before this gate passes. The agent cannot self-approve.

## Hard Boundary Rules

This command must not:

- write any feature code, `src-code-frontend/`, or `src-code-backend/` — it never scaffolds
- write to `spec/business/` — the business spec is read-only input
- write to `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`, the `rules-seed/` staging tree, `speccraft.scaffold.md`, or any Tier 4 file before the human review gate returns `approved`
- run if real application code already exists (Pre-Execution Check 0)
- run if `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` already has real `AD-FRONTEND-*`/`AD-BACKEND-*` content (Pre-Execution Check 1)
- silently default a Layer Scope recommendation the BRD gives no usable signal for — mark it `unclear` and let the human decide at the gate
- draft `spec/architecture/NFR-SUMMARY.md` content or an API contract reference — both stay out of scope for this command (see Non-Goals)

---

## Failure And Block Conditions

- real application code already exists for a layer this BRD likely touches — refuse, point to `/speccraft.onboard [path]`
- `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` already has real `AD-FRONTEND-*`/`AD-BACKEND-*` content and no code exists — refuse, point to manual edit
- `<business-spec-file>` missing or unreadable
- `<tech stack description>` omitted — stop and ask for it, do not draft from the BRD alone
- stated stack description asserts two mutually exclusive values for the same required Tier 1 field (genuine self-contradiction, not just an unstated field) — `blocked: [reason]`, ask for clarification
- BRD gives no usable Layer Scope signal for one layer — mark `unclear`, let the human decide, do not default
- human responds `revise` — redraft the affected tier(s) and re-present; do not partially apply an unapproved draft

---

## Relationship To `/speccraft.onboard`

Mutually exclusive entry points into the same destination file. `/speccraft.onboard` is for a codebase that already has real running code to scan; `/speccraft.plan-foundation` is for a codebase that has neither, only a business spec and a stated intent. Each refuses to run in the other's situation (see Pre-Execution Checks). Once either has run and been approved, the project is in the same state — a populated `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` — and both hand off identically into `/speccraft.scaffold`.

## Relationship To `/speccraft.scaffold`

This command does not invoke `/speccraft.scaffold` and does not create either code root. It exists specifically to make `/speccraft.scaffold frontend`/`/speccraft.scaffold backend` immediately runnable afterward — every one of scaffold's Pre-Execution Checks that currently blocks on an empty `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` or an empty placeholder section should pass once this command's output is approved. Scaffold's step 7 checks for this command's staged `rules-seed/<layer>/` output before falling back to creating empty folders.

## Relationship To `/speccraft.tech-design`

`/speccraft.tech-design`'s only fallback today, when Layer Scope or a required `AD-*` row is missing, is a bare interactive chat question with no stack-proposal logic. This command is the guided alternative to that fallback for a project that has a BRD ready but hasn't yet answered root `README.md` §Before You Start steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 by hand. Running this command first means `/speccraft.tech-design` never has to fall back to the bare question at all.

---

## Non-Goals

- discovering or scanning any existing code — that is `/speccraft.onboard`'s job exclusively; this command assumes zero code exists
- inventing business requirements not present in the named business spec — it only reads the BRD to infer Layer Scope and cross-reference stated non-goals (e.g. "no auth"), never to add scope
- writing feature code, running `/speccraft.scaffold`, or creating either code root
- amending an already-locked `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` — see Pre-Execution Check 1
- drafting `spec/architecture/NFR-SUMMARY.md` — NFR enforcement stays optional and manual (root `README.md` §Before You Start step 6), independent of this command
- drafting or referencing an API contract file — root `README.md` §Before You Start step 10 only applies when a story modifies an already-existing contract, which a fresh greenfield BRD's first story never does

---

## Minimal Command Handoff

```text
Command: /speccraft.plan-foundation <business-spec-file> "<tech stack description>"
Layer Scope Recommended: frontend / backend / both / unclear (per layer)
Layer Scope Confirmed: frontend / backend / both
Tier 1 Draft Rows Proposed: <count> (stated-stack: <n>, stack-convention: <n>, BRD: <n>)
Tier 2 Seed Entries Proposed: <count>
Tier 3 Scaffold Sections Filled: Required Stack / Required Folder Structure / .env.example / Config File Requirements
Tier 4 Architecture Files Proposed: <count> (per layer, may be zero)
Review Outcome: approved / revise / blocked
ARCH-DECISIONS.md Written: yes / no
rules-seed/ Staged: yes / no
speccraft.scaffold.md Placeholders Filled: yes / no
Tier 4 Files Written: yes / no
Current State: complete / blocked
Next Recommended Action:
```

---

## Exit Behavior

After a run completes:

1. output the minimal handoff block above
2. STOP — do not proceed to `/speccraft.scaffold` or any planning stage until the human confirms the written `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`, staged `rules-seed/`, filled `speccraft.scaffold.md` sections, and any Tier 4 files are acceptable

No traceability or progress artifact is written by this command — unlike onboard, scaffold, and the orchestrate-chained stages, which track per-story workflow metrics, this is a one-time, pre-story foundation-setup step with nothing to track against a story.

Running once per project is expected — same one-time-per-project spirit as steps 2–3/4/5/7–8 of root `README.md` §Before You Start, which this command replaces.

---

## Relationship To Other Documents

Read this document together with:

- `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` — the target for Tier 1 output
- `spec/architecture/README.md` — Layer Scope resolution rule, extended to recommend this command when no code exists yet but a business spec does
- `spec/AGENTS.md` — Layer Scope Precondition (universal gate this command satisfies via a drafted-then-confirmed recommendation, not a blind ask)
- `spec/ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCES.md` — the index Tier 4 output is added to
- root `README.md` — §Before You Start, New Project Setup (this command replaces steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 for a greenfield project with a BRD ready)
- `spec/commands/speccraft.onboard.md` — the brownfield counterpart this command deliberately does not overlap with
- `spec/commands/speccraft.scaffold.md` — the command this one deliberately does not invoke, but makes immediately runnable

# speccraft.orchestrate.md

## Purpose

This document defines the command contract for the master end-to-end workflow orchestration command.

Command shape:

```text
/speccraft.orchestrate <business-spec-file>
```

This command is the single entry point to chain the entire delivery workflow from a business spec input to validated, traced full-stack delivery output. It orchestrates both planning and execution in sequence, enforcing review gates, revision loops, and traceability at every stage, and fans one business spec out into linked frontend and backend delivery streams.

---

## Why This Exists

Without an orchestration command contract:

- agents may run stages out of order
- review gates may be skipped by assumption
- traceability may be built only at the end instead of progressively
- blocked work may be retried without context
- human-in-the-loop pause points may be inconsistent across sessions
- the end-to-end workflow state may not be recoverable after interruption
- frontend and backend work may drift out of sync with no shared checkpoint

This document makes `/speccraft.orchestrate` the authoritative orchestration contract and makes the full workflow resumable, auditable, and human-reviewable at any stage boundary, for both layers together.

---

## Command Intent

`/speccraft.orchestrate <business-spec-file>` means:

- take the named business specification file as the starting input
- execute the full planning and execution workflow in order
- fan Stage 2 out into the LLD artifact(s) for this project's Layer Scope (one or two, per `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` §Layer Scope) from the single intake
- enforce review gates at every stage boundary
- pause for human-in-the-loop at any gate that produces `revise` or `blocked`
- update traceability progressively throughout execution, not only at the end
- track progress in `spec/progress/` at every stage
- produce or update artifacts in their correct locations at each stage, routed to the correct layer's code root
- run Stage 10 (Integration Testing) and Stage 11 (its review gate) only for tasks tagged `Layer: backend`
- report current state, artifact state, and next required action at every pause point

This command does not:

- skip review gates
- self-approve locked artifacts across phase boundaries
- allow execution to begin before planning is fully approved
- allow later stages to begin before earlier stages are approved
- run Stage 10/11 for frontend-tagged tasks — those tasks go straight from Stage 9 to Stage 12

---

## Required Input

The command requires:

- one business specification file reference

Accepted examples:

```text
/speccraft.orchestrate spec/business/BUSINESS-SPEC-001.md
```

The file must be:

- readable
- in scope for the current repository work
- strong enough to support planning LLD creation for the in-scope layer(s)

---

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Step zero, before check 1 below and before anything else in this command — including reading the business spec file:** capture the real wall-clock `Start` timestamp per `spec/workflows/shared/SHARED-POLICIES.md` §Duration Capture. Non-skippable — applies even when this run ends immediately in `blocked`.

This top-level capture is separate from, and does not substitute for, the `Start` capture each individual stage's underlying command contract (`speccraft.tech-design.md`, `speccraft.decompose.md`, `speccraft.implement.md`, etc.) makes on its own behalf when `/speccraft.orchestrate` invokes it — each of those commands still captures and records its own `Start`/`End` for its own `Workflow Metrics` row, per its own contract, exactly as if it had been invoked directly by a human. `/speccraft.orchestrate` orchestrating the sequence does not collapse per-stage timestamp capture into one top-level measurement.

Before the workflow begins, the command should confirm:

1. the business spec file exists and is readable
2. the business scope can be identified from the file
3. stable requirement references exist or can be established during intake
4. this project's Layer Scope is resolved (`spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` §Layer Scope — ask interactively if the file is empty/placeholder, per `spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md` Pre-Execution Check 0) and relevant architecture references are known for the in-scope layer(s) (the `AD-*` section(s) matching them, plus any `AD-X-*` cross-cutting decisions)

If these checks fail materially, the command should not proceed and should state the blocker explicitly.

---

## Documents This Command Must Use

This command orchestrates the entire workflow and must use all documents listed below.

Root policy documents:

- `spec/AGENTS.md`
- `spec/init.md`
- `spec/WORKFLOW-OVERVIEW.md`
- `spec/SPEC-HIERARCHY.md`
- `spec/REVIEW-AND-REVISION-POLICY.md`

Shared workflow documents:

- `spec/workflows/shared/STAGE-CONTRACT.md`
- `spec/workflows/shared/TRACEABILITY-RULES.md`
- `spec/workflows/shared/SHARED-POLICIES.md` (approval states, done criteria, handoff format, metrics rules, conflict-decision rules)

Stage documents (one consolidated `*-STAGE.md` per stage — each covers entry/input/output contracts, review checklist, revision rules, done criteria):

- `spec/workflows/lld/LLD-STAGE.md` (covers Intake and LLD Creation; produces the FRONTEND/BACKEND LLD pair)
- `spec/workflows/decomposition/DECOMPOSITION-STAGE.md`
- `spec/workflows/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION-STAGE.md`
- `spec/workflows/testing/TESTING-STAGE.md`
- `spec/workflows/integration-testing/INTEGRATION-TESTING-STAGE.md` — **read only when a task's `Layer` is `backend`**
- `spec/workflows/validation/VALIDATION-STAGE.md`

Architecture documents:

- all files under `spec/architecture/` — **read before Stage 2**; locked cross-story decisions; never re-derived per story; note the `AD-FRONTEND-*` / `AD-BACKEND-*` / `AD-X-*` prefixes in `ARCH-DECISIONS.md`

Command contracts:

- `spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md`
- `spec/commands/speccraft.decompose.md`
- `spec/commands/speccraft.implement.md`
- `spec/commands/speccraft.unit-test.md`
- `spec/commands/speccraft.integration-test.md` — conditionally invoked, backend-tagged tasks only
- `spec/commands/speccraft.validate.md`

---

## Expected Command Behavior

The command executes stages in the following fixed order. Each stage must complete review before the next begins. Stages 1-5.5 operate once per story across both layers. Stages 6-13 operate per task; Stage 10-11 branch per task on the task's `Layer` field.

### Stage 1: Business Spec Intake

- read the business spec file
- identify or establish stable requirement IDs (layer-agnostic — every in-scope LLD will cite the same IDs)
- confirm that the business scope is well-defined enough to begin LLD creation
- record intake output (single intake record, not split per layer)

### Stage 2: LLD Creation

- invoke LLD creation behavior as defined in `spec/commands/speccraft.tech-design.md`
- read this project's Layer Scope from `spec/architecture/ARCH-DECISIONS.md` §Layer Scope before invoking
- from the one approved intake, produce the LLD artifact(s) for the in-scope layer(s), mirrored per business module:
  - Layer Scope `frontend` -> `spec/lld/<module>/LLD-FRONTEND-<STORY-ID>.md` only
  - Layer Scope `backend` -> `spec/lld/<module>/LLD-BACKEND-<STORY-ID>.md` only
  - Layer Scope `both` -> both files, exactly as before this feature existed
- when Layer Scope is `both`, each LLD includes a Companion LLD Reference section naming its pair and any cross-layer contract dependency; when Layer Scope is single-layer, that section states there is no companion
- update traceability: requirement IDs -> LLD sections, for the in-scope LLD(s)

### Stage 3: LLD Review Gate

**HARD STOP. Do not proceed in the same execution.**

After Stage 2 produces the in-scope LLD artifact(s):

- output the in-scope LLD file path(s), a summary of what each covers, and the minimal handoff block
- STOP execution here
- wait for human response in the next conversation turn
- do not self-evaluate any LLD and proceed to Stage 4 in the same execution
- do not produce tasks, write code, or take any downstream action until every in-scope LLD is explicitly approved

When Layer Scope = `both`, this is one logical gate covering the pair — the human responds once for both artifacts together. When Layer Scope is single-layer, this gate covers the single artifact.

Allowed human responses:
- `approved` — every in-scope LLD approved; proceed to Stage 4 in the next execution
- `revise: [reason]` — return to LLD creation; under Layer Scope = `both`, a revise on one LLD does not require redoing the other, but Stage 4 does not open until both are independently approved
- `blocked: [reason]` — stop, record blocker, require human decision before continuing

The AI must not infer approval from silence or from its own review of the artifacts it just produced.

### Stage 4: Decomposition

- invoke decomposition behavior as defined in `spec/commands/speccraft.decompose.md`
- signature: `/speccraft.decompose <lld-fe-file> <lld-be-file>` when Layer Scope = `both` (both approved LLDs read together); `/speccraft.decompose <lld-file>` when Layer Scope is single-layer (the one approved LLD is sufficient input)
- produce task files in `spec/tasks/<module>/` (mirrored per module, flat, no `tasks/` subfolder) for the in-scope layer(s), each filename tagged `-FRONTEND-`/`-BACKEND-` and each carrying a mandatory `Layer: frontend|backend` metadata field matching the in-scope layer it was derived from
- cross-layer task dependencies (only possible when Layer Scope = `both`; e.g. a BACKEND endpoint task the FRONTEND task consumes) are expressed via the existing `Dependencies` field, citing a task ID from the other layer; ordering is dependency-driven only — no blanket "backend tasks before frontend tasks" rule, a task with no cross-layer dependency has no forced order
- update traceability: LLD sections -> task IDs, for the in-scope layer(s)

### Stage 5: Decomposition Review Gate

**HARD STOP. Do not proceed in the same execution.**

After Stage 4 decomposition task files are produced:

- output the task list (in-scope layer(s)), execution order, sizing rationale, and minimal handoff block
- STOP execution here
- wait for human response in the next conversation turn
- do not self-evaluate the decomposition and proceed to execution in the same execution
- do not scaffold, write code, or take any downstream action until explicit approval is received

Allowed human responses:
- `approved` — planning complete; proceed to Stage 5.5 and execution in the next execution
- `revise: [reason]` — return to decomposition, revise tasks, resubmit
- `blocked: [reason]` — stop, record blocker, require human decision before continuing

The AI must not infer approval from silence or from its own review of the artifacts it just produced.

### Stage 5.5: Project Scaffold Check

Before any task-to-code work begins for a given layer, confirm that layer's code root exists at repository root.

- if a task is `Layer: frontend` and `src-code-frontend/` does not exist: run `/speccraft.scaffold frontend` first and confirm it is complete before proceeding with that task
- if a task is `Layer: backend` and `src-code-backend/` does not exist: run `/speccraft.scaffold backend` first and confirm it is complete before proceeding with that task
- the two scaffolds are independent — one may exist without the other, and they may be run in either order
- each scaffold happens exactly once for the repository lifetime; it is not repeated per task or per workflow run

### Stage 6: Task-To-Code Execution

- for each approved task (executed sequentially by default):
  - read the task file's `Layer` field first
  - route: `Layer: frontend` -> write to `src-code-frontend/`, read `ARCH-DECISIONS.md` AD-FRONTEND-* section, read `src-code-frontend/AGENTS.md` + `src-code-frontend/rules/`; `Layer: backend` -> write to `src-code-backend/`, read AD-BACKEND-* section, read `src-code-backend/AGENTS.md` + `src-code-backend/rules/`
  - produce implementation output in the routed code root
  - update traceability: task ID -> changed files

### Stage 7: Implementation Review Gate

- for each implemented task:
  - submit implementation for review
  - allowed outcomes: `approved`, `revise`, `blocked`
  - if `revise`: enter revision loop, return to review
  - if `blocked`: report blocker, pause, require human-in-the-loop resolution
  - if `approved`: proceed to Stage 8 for this task

### Stage 8: Code-To-Unit-Tests Generation

- for each task with approved implementation:
  - read the task's `Layer` field; produce unit tests under that layer's test convention (`src-code-frontend/` or `src-code-backend/`)
  - update traceability: changed files -> test files

### Stage 9: Testing Review Gate

- for each task's test output:
  - submit tests for review
  - allowed outcomes: `approved`, `revise`, `blocked`
  - if `revise`: enter revision loop, return to review
  - if `blocked`: report blocker, pause, require human-in-the-loop resolution
  - if `approved`: proceed **per this task's `Layer`** — `backend` -> Stage 10; `frontend` -> skip Stage 10 and 11, proceed directly to Stage 12

### Stage 10: Integration Testing Generation — CONDITIONAL (backend-tagged tasks only)

- applies only to tasks with `Layer: backend`; frontend-tagged tasks do not enter this stage
- for each backend task with approved implementation and approved unit tests:
  - invoke integration testing behavior as defined in `spec/commands/speccraft.integration-test.md`
  - produce or update integration test files covering cross-boundary behavior (API contract, persistence, external integration)
  - update traceability: unit tests -> integration tests

### Stage 11: Integration Testing Review Gate — CONDITIONAL (backend-tagged tasks only)

- applies only to tasks with `Layer: backend`
- for each task's integration test output:
  - submit tests for review
  - allowed outcomes: `approved`, `revise`, `blocked`
  - if `revise`: enter revision loop, return to review
  - if `blocked`: report blocker, pause, require human-in-the-loop resolution
  - if `approved`: proceed to Stage 12 for this task

### Stage 12: Final Validation

- for each task:
  - `Layer: frontend` — requires approved implementation and approved unit tests (Stages 6-9 only); invoke final validation behavior as defined in `spec/commands/speccraft.validate.md` and verify the 4-link chain (req -> LLD -> task -> code -> test)
  - `Layer: backend` — requires approved implementation, approved unit tests, and approved integration tests (Stages 6-11); invoke final validation behavior as defined in `spec/commands/speccraft.validate.md` and verify the 5-link chain (req -> LLD -> task -> code -> unit test -> integration test)
  - produce validation record in the `### Validation` section under `## Task: TASK-{id}` in `spec/progress/<module>/progress-{STORY-ID}.md`

### Stage 13: Progress And Traceability Updates

- update all progress artifacts to reflect completion state, for both layers
- confirm full traceability chain per task: frontend tasks show the 4-link chain, backend tasks show the 5-link chain, both visible in the one traceability shard's `Layer` column
- record any remaining open questions or gaps explicitly
- mark the work item `done` only if all checks pass and all gaps are recorded

---

## Output Expectations

Stage-by-stage outputs:

- Stage 1: intake record, stable requirement IDs
- Stage 2: `spec/lld/<module>/LLD-FRONTEND-{STORY-ID}.md` and/or `spec/lld/<module>/LLD-BACKEND-{STORY-ID}.md`, per Layer Scope
- Stage 4: task files in `spec/tasks/<module>/TASK-{STORY-ID}-FRONTEND-T{n}.md` and/or `TASK-{STORY-ID}-BACKEND-T{n}.md`, per Layer Scope
- Stage 6: implementation output (changed files, in `src-code-frontend/` or `src-code-backend/` per task `Layer`)
- Stage 8: unit test files
- Stage 10: integration test files — backend-tagged tasks only
- Stage 12: validation record in the `### Validation` section under `## Task: TASK-{id}` in `spec/progress/<module>/progress-{STORY-ID}.md`
- Stage 13: updated traceability and progress artifacts

Progress is recorded in `spec/progress/` throughout execution.

Traceability is updated in `spec/traceability/` at each stage — one shard per story, with a `Layer` column showing both chains together.

---

## Traceability Expectations

Traceability is progressive throughout the entire workflow, not built only at the end.

At minimum, this command must maintain:

- requirement ID -> LLD section (created at Stage 2, for every in-scope LLD)
- LLD section -> task ID (created at Stage 4, for the in-scope layer(s))
- task ID -> code changes (created at Stage 6)
- code changes -> unit tests (created at Stage 8)
- unit tests -> integration tests (created at Stage 10, backend-tagged tasks only)

If the workflow stops at any stage, traceability for all produced artifacts must still be updated before the session ends.

---

## Review Expectations

Every stage boundary has a review gate. No stage may advance without an explicit review outcome.

Allowed review outcomes:

- `approved`: proceed to the next stage
- `revise`: return to the producing stage, revise, resubmit for review
- `blocked`: stop, report the blocker, require human-in-the-loop resolution

The workflow may not self-approve any artifact produced in the same execution step.

---

## Pause Point Behavior

The command must pause at every `revise` or `blocked` outcome and report the current state using the minimal handoff format below.

At any pause point, the agent must report:

- which stage produced the outcome
- what artifact is affected (and which layer)
- what the outcome was
- what must happen before the workflow can resume
- what stages are complete and what stages remain, per layer

---

## Failure And Block Conditions

The command should stop and report `blocked` when:

- the business spec is too vague to support LLD creation
- stable requirement references cannot be established
- an architecture conflict is discovered that cannot be resolved within the stage
- a review gate produces `blocked`
- execution discovers a gap that requires reopening a planning artifact
- any stage cannot proceed without a decision the agent cannot make unilaterally
- **API contract conflicts with the business user story** — append conflict row(s) to current story traceability shard before stopping
- **design reference / screenshot conflicts with the business user story** — append conflict row(s) to current story traceability shard before stopping
- **a user story conflicts with existing code from another approved story** — append conflict row(s) to current story traceability shard before stopping
- **one user story conflicts with another approved user story** — append conflict row(s) to current story traceability shard before stopping
- **a new LLD conflicts with an existing approved LLD touching the same module/resource/endpoint** — append conflict row(s) to current story traceability shard before stopping
- **`LLD-FRONTEND-<id>.md` and `LLD-BACKEND-<id>.md` for the same story contradict each other's contract** (e.g. FRONTEND assumes a request/response shape the BACKEND LLD's actual endpoint contract does not provide) — same-story cross-layer conflict, applies only when Layer Scope = `both`; blocked the same way, logged in Conflict Decisions the same way

For all conflict-triggered blocks: one row per conflicting element in `spec/traceability/<mirrored-business-path>/TRACEABILITY.md` under `Conflict Decisions`, status `open`, no LLD section or code change for that area until status becomes `resolved` or `deferred`. Schema and rules: `spec/workflows/shared/SHARED-POLICIES.md`.

The command should report `revise` when a review gate finds issues that can be resolved by revising within the current stage.

---

## Hard Boundary Rules

This command must respect all phase and stage boundaries.

Rules:

- execution must not begin until planning is fully approved (every in-scope LLD independently approved — both, when Layer Scope = `both`)
- implementation must not begin until decomposition is approved
- testing must not begin until implementation is approved
- integration testing must not begin until unit testing is approved, and only applies to backend-tagged tasks
- final validation must not begin until testing is approved (and, for backend tasks, integration testing is approved)
- no earlier-phase artifact may be silently changed during a later stage
- if an execution discovery requires a planning change, stop and escalate
- **AI must not self-approve artifacts it produced in the same execution step**
- **`approved` is a human-provided response, never an AI inference**
- **Stage 3 and Stage 5 are HARD STOPS that end the current execution turn**
- the workflow spans multiple conversation turns — each review gate requires a new human message before the next stage begins
- proceeding past a review gate without an explicit human approval response is a workflow violation
- a task's `Layer` field determines its code root and whether Stage 10/11 apply — commands must branch on the `Layer` field programmatically, not on the filename tag alone

---

## Human-In-The-Loop Triggers

Human escalation is required when:

- any review gate produces `blocked`
- a business source is materially contradictory or incomplete
- a source-to-architecture conflict exists that cannot be resolved within scope
- a scope change would require reopening a locked artifact
- the workflow has been paused and must be resumed with new context
- any stage produces output that the agent cannot honestly approve
- `LLD-FRONTEND-<id>.md` and `LLD-BACKEND-<id>.md` disagree on a shared contract (Layer Scope = `both` only)

The agent must not self-approve corrections across phase boundaries.

---

## Minimal Command Handoff

At every pause point or session end, the command must report:

```text
Command: /speccraft.orchestrate
Business Spec: <file>
Current Phase: <1 or 2>
Current Stage: <stage name>
Last Artifact: <path>
Last Artifact State: <draft|in-review|revise|approved|blocked|done>
Stages Complete: <list, per layer where applicable>
Stages Remaining: <list, per layer where applicable>
Blockers Or Open Questions: <list or none>
Next Required Action: <what must happen>
```

This handoff format must be produced at every pause point so that any human or AI collaborator can resume the workflow without losing context.
